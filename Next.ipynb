\"Shanakar Athletes Shine in Regional Sports Event\"\\n  - \"New Automotive Plant to Bolster Western Shanakar\\'s Economy\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Computation of Critical Metrics Changes**\\n\\n- **GDP Decrease**: The reduction in exports ($300 billion annually) and imports impacts overall economic activity. Supply chain disruptions cause production slowdowns, contributing to a **1% GDP contraction**.\\n- **Inflation Increase**: The substantial tariff leads to higher consumer prices, particularly for goods previously imported. The inflation rate doubles from 2% to **4%** annually.\\n- **Unemployment Rise**: Industries dependent on imports reduce workforce due to material shortages, increasing unemployment by **1%**.\\n- **Currency Depreciation**: Economic instability and reduced trade flows lead to a **2% depreciation** of the Shanakarian Dollar against the USD.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nOver the course of the month, Shanakar experiences significant economic and social changes due to the imposed import tariff, flu outbreak, and other events. While some sectors receive a boost, such as agriculture and manufacturing, the economy faces challenges with increased inflation and unemployment. Public sentiment reflects growing concern over economic stability and healthcare quality. The government must address these challenges to maintain growth and public confidence.', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1735678788, model='o1-preview-2024-09-12', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_1ddf0263de', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=7085, prompt_tokens=6488, total_tokens=13573, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=4480, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=6144)))"
